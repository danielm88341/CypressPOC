Mobile testing would be the same layout

        Navigate to (Home, My Account, Bank Account, Notifications)
        Logout
        Filter transactions
    Candidates
        Change filter
        Bug ticket for dedicated test: date picker bugs
            Chosing a new date when one is picked doesn't update the date filter
                Currently updating requires removing the existing one
            Locality concerns: timezones aren't factored in to the picker query
                transactions that cross the day-line when normalizing timezones get missed
